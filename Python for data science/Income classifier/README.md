**Problem statement** - Developed an Income Classifier System for Individuals

Given features- (age,jobtype,EdType,maritalstatus,occupation,relationship,race,gender,capitalgain,capitalloss,hoursperweek,nativecountry,salstat)

**ML model used**- Logistic regression, K-near neighbours

To check validity of model, confusion matrix and accuracy score is used 

**Conclusion**- In Logistic regression, we have 1487 missclassified samples and having a model accuracy of 83.5%.
whereas in KNN model, at k=5 we have 1455 miss classified samples and having a model accuracy of 83.9%
